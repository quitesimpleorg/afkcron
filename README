afkcron
=======
afkcron simply reports the idle time of the X11 server to a shell script.

Originally, it was reading config files and also handling the return of the
user by decreasing priority of launched processes or killing them etc.

Now I considered it's best for it to be rather stupid and delegate this 
to a shell script for example. 

Launching afkcron
=================
afkcron [path to script] [how often idle time should be polled, in seconds]

Example: afkcron script.sh 30 

Shellscript
===========
First argument: "active" (if idle time has stopped), "idle": When idling
Second argument: the number of seconds X11 is idling.

Dependencies
============
libX11, libXss. Should be a given.
